AC Analysis `Freq': freq = (10 Hz -> 1 GHz)
*******************************************

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `Freq'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(X1.n_wire1) = -2.24488 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.

DC simulation time: CPU = 2.394 ms, elapsed = 1.34206 ms.
